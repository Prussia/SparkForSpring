SparkForSpring
==============

Placeholder until I get the real code in.  Postponing to 9/26 so I can 
re-validate the app runs on the Spark cluster, and I have packaging instructions.

About

SparkForSpring includes the relevant pieces of code presented at the
SpringOne2014 session: An Introduction to Apache Spark For Spring Developers(*)
The goal is to present an application built using general Spring constructs
that also runs Spark code.

This sample application usecase is analyzin and displaying data captured from the launch of 
a high-powered model rocket.  What's important for our purposes is that we have a
data set to analyze, and two flights are available in the project.
